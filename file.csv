This symposium investigates how foundational and model-based conceptions of Bayesianism relate to each other, and how they might cross-fertilize each other. More specifically, we address this general question from three perspectives: theories of valid inductive inference, understanding Bayesian models as scientific models, and comparing Bayesian models to competitors. At the end, we combine these perspectives to explain the popularity of Bayesianism in various fields of philosophy and science.</p>","Confirmation and Evidence","","Remote Presentation","Modeling Limitations versus the Limitations of a Model|Bayesian Philosophy of Science as Scientific Philosophy|Bayes, Here, There, but Not Everywhere|Commentary||"," Stephan Hartmann, Christopher Hitchcock, John D Norton, Michael Titelbaum, Jan Sprenger","PSA Office,  Jessica Pfeifer,  Matthew Parker","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"21","Session","Beyond Explanation: Exploring the Diversity of Neuroscientific Practice","2021-11-11","13:00:00","15:00:00","<p>The philosophy of neuroscience has in recent decades been dominated by discussions of explanation and in particular of mechanistic explanation. This has produced significant insights into the kinds of causal knowledge that neuroscientific experiments can deliver. However, the focus on explanation has also arguably had a distorting effect on the field. For example, it has encouraged the tendency to lump together or subsume all neuroscientific techniques and models of interest under the heading of explanation (see, for example, debates over whether topological or dynamical ""explanations"" of neural phenomena are really deserving of the name). But the epistemic terrain of neuroscience is far more varied and interesting than this, and it includes knowledge-producing practices that go beyond explanation. Neuroscientific practice includes the development of tools and experimental systems, data analytic techniques, exploratory investigations, formal descriptive frameworks, predictive simulations, and new laboratory phenomena, as well as a host of clinical translational applications. While these may contribute to explanation, they are nevertheless distinct from it. This symposium aims to articulate the social, material, and normative characteristics of these non-explanatory neuroscientific practices, and to chart their interrelations.</p>","Philosophy of Neuroscience","","Remote Presentation","The Mirage of Big-Data Phrenology|Exploratory Concept Formation and the Norms of Description in Neuroscientific Discovery|Assessing the Dynamics of Novel Tool Development: The Rodent Operant Touchscreen Chamber as a Case Study |The Predictive Turn In Neuroscience||","Jackie Sullivan, Daniel Weiskopf, Philipp Haueis, Felipe De Brigard","PSA Office,  Jorge Morales,  Jessica Pfeifer","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"23","Session","Control and Regulation of Biological Mechanisms","2021-11-11","13:00:00","15:00:00","<p>This symposium will address a topic that so far has been little discussed in philosophy of science: how biological mechanisms are controlled and regulated to serve the needs of the organisms in which they occur. Control plays a critical role since, in living organisms, mechanisms typically perform their activities only when they are required to build or maintain the organism and so must do so in different ways under different conditions. This symposium aims to articulate a framework for understanding how biological mechanisms are controlled. The first contributions articulate insights about control by theoretical biologists and cyberneticists in the mid-20th century that have not been fully incorporated into philosophical thinking about mechanisms. One critical insight is that controlled mechanisms require flexible components on which other mechanisms, control mechanisms, can operate. A second is that these control mechanisms are responsive to conditions in the organism or its environment so as to alter flexible components in the controlled mechanisms so that they operate in ways needed by the organism. The later contributions focus on examples of research on control mechanisms, investigating how this research exhibits both similarities and differences to the accounts of mechanism discovery that focus on controlled mechanisms.</p>","Mechanisms","","Remote Presentation","Can Control be Accounted for on a Mechanistic Picture?|Basic Forms of Control in Multicellular Systems|Discovering Control Mechanisms Operative on Cytoplasmic Dyneins|||","William Bechtel, Leonardo Bich, Jason Winning","PSA Office,  Daniel Brooks,  Jessica Pfeifer","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition to this focus, philosophers and scientists have more recently turned their attention to a new and important topic–how to distinguish among different types of causal relationships. This symposium proposal contributes to this endeavor by analyzing four novel features of type-causal relationships, which have yet to receive significant attention in the literature. These features include: the degree to which causal relationships exhibit (i) [ir]reversibility, (ii) invariance, (iii) coherence, and (iv) machine-likeness. These features are examined in four separate talks (one co-authored), provided by four philosophers and one scientist, who all conduct research on causation and causal reasoning. Each of these talks examine one of the four features above by providing an analysis of how this feature should be understood, what distinction within causation it clarifies, and why this distinction matters to scientific practice, as well as everyday causal reasoning.</p>","Causality","Key Ballroom 01","Hybrid Presentation","Irreversible and Reversible Causation|Representations of Invariance in Human Causal Induction|Coherent Causal Control|Biological Machines: A Sober Defense||","Lauren Ross, James Woodward, Mimi Liljeholm, Arnon Levy, Marcel Weber","Dr. Daniel Kostic","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The participants will discuss and compare the variety of mathematical tools that have been developed while exploring their relation with standing philosophical issues. The symposium aims to (i) explore different points of view concerning the relevance of quantization procedures to questions of inter-theoretic reduction between classical and quantum mechanics, (ii) consider how different approaches to understanding the emergence of classical behavior are influenced by background assumptions concerning realism or anti-realism in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, and (iii) probe the extent to which quantization methods can aid in the interpretation and ontology of quantum theories, especially concerning the nature of charge and particles in field theories.</p>","Philosophy of Physics - quantum mechanics","Key Ballroom 02","Hybrid Presentation","On the Singularity of the Classical Limit|Deformation Quantization and the Emergence of Particles from Quantum Field Theory|Viewing Quantum Charge from the Classical Vantage Point|Decoherence and Deformation Quantization: Complementary or Rival Explanations of Classical Behavior?||","Benjamin Feintzeig, Marian J.

While the parlance of ""transfer"" conveys a conservative process in nature, a growing number of case studies suggests that modifying the body of knowledge or the subject matter to which it applies is indispensable to a satisfactory trans-domain transfer. There is thus a need to address both the conservation and adaptation aspects in the cross-disciplinary transfer of models and their associated knowledge. Tackling this issue, the first two talks clarify and refine notions of ""templates"" for analyzing model transfer. The last two talks focus on the process and the practice of circulating models as templates across disciplines.

Adopting such a pluralistic framework, recent work in feminist philosophy of science as well as in philosophy of medicine has emphasized taxonomic pluralism and the possibility of the coexistence of crosscutting classifications of scientific domains, each of which captures important aspects of the (complex) target of scientific inquiry. This symposium proposal takes cues from these discussions, and explores their implications for the philosophy of psychiatry. Mental disorder is an intricate and multi-dimensional phenomenon that is intimately tied to an individual, their biology, and their social and cultural contexts, warranting multiple explanatory frameworks to enhance psychiatric epistemology. Papers in the symposium will examine how psychiatric knowledge is made by reflecting on taxonomies that are based on biological mechanisms, natural kinds, theoretical causal models, as well as those incorporating patients' perspectives and realities. Rather than presupposing that there is one correct taxonomy for psychiatric disorders, these papers proceed on the assumption that different psychiatric taxonomies track different properties and processes, thereby serving different interests (e.g., explanation, prediction, intervention).</p>","Feminist Philosophy of Science","Key Ballroom 10","In-Person Presentation","Biological Essentialism and the Projectability of Psychiatric Categories|Pluralism in Psychiatry Encompasses both Natural and Practical Kinds|Pluralism and Progress in Psychiatry|Reclassifying Body Dysmorphic Disorder:  A Causal Model Informed by the Patient’s Perspective|Participatory Intersubjective Objectivity in Psychiatric Epistemology|Commentary","Jonathan Y.

It also comes with a rather rich lexical field that includes notions such as equilibrium, balance, resilience, resistance to disturbance, and ecosystem health. Indeed, stability is part of many conceptual frameworks in ecology and as such, it shapes how researchers apprehend and describe their target system. Perhaps unsurprisingly, debates surrounding this notion are also quite diverse. Many have debated how to define and measure various forms of stability, others have discussed whether it is present or absent in ecological entities, and yet others have endorsed it, sometimes implicitly, as a value in ecological management.

Each transition involved a qualitative change in information flow within nervous systems. Each transition opened up new cognitive capacities, while transforming the power and scope of existing cognitive functions.

We propose a symposium that contributes to the existing philosophical debate about meta-analysis while also extending the literature to address the questions about meta-analysis and replication, meta-analysis and the incentive structures of science, and the role of meta-analysis in other disciplines (e.g. ecology).</p>","Confirmation and Evidence","Key Ballroom 09","Hybrid Presentation","Conventional Choices in Outcome Measures Influence Meta-Analytic Results|Replication Is for Meta-analysis|Reliability Weighting in Meta-analysis as a Response to the Replication Crisis |Just Leave It Alone?

In this symposium, we discuss a particular interventionist approach, which we call ""philosophy in science (PinS)"", i.e., an attempt at using philosophical tools to make a significant scientific contribution. This approach remains rare, but has been very successful in a number of cases, especially in philosophy of biology, medicine, physics, statistics, and the social sciences. Our goal is to provide a description of PinS through both a bibliometric approach and the examination of specific case studies. We also aim to explain how PinS differs from mainstream philosophy of science and partly similar approaches such as ""philosophy of science in practice"".</p>","Doing philosophy of science - methods and tools","","Remote Presentation","Philosophy in Science: Definition and Boundaries|My Philosophical Interventions in Statistics|Philosophical Interventions in Science –  a Strategy and a Case Study (Parsimony)|How Evolutionary Science and Philosophy Can Collaborate to Redefine Disease||","Thomas Pradeu, Deborah Mayo, Mael Lemoine, Elliott Sober, Randolph Nesse, Paul Griffiths","PSA Office,  Ruobin Gong,  Jessica Pfeifer","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has given rise to a surge of interest in ethical issues relating AI, such as algorithmic bias and opacity. While these issues have been extensively debated within applied ethics, philosophers of science have started to recognize that many of them also overlap with current debates in philosophy of science. For instance, the issue of algorithmic bias raises issues of epistemic risk and value-ladenness, while debates over the opacity and interpretability of advanced AI systems raise issues about the nature of explanation and understanding. Furthermore, they raise methodological questions about the sciences that produce these technologies, how research can be organized to produce ethical AI, and what responsibility scientists within these disciplines have to ensure this. This symposium aims to explore AI ethics through the lens of philosophy of science.</p>","Values in Science","","Remote Presentation","Unbiased Algorithms in a Biased Society?

These practices pose challenges to philosophy of science, including questions about the justification of possibility claims, the representation of possibilities through models, the distinction of genuine from non-genuine possibilities, and what the relevant concept(s) of 'possibility' is in a given field. We advance understanding of these problems by analyzing the possibility claims and the associated practices with tools and arguments from modal epistemology. Although modal epistemology has only addressed scientific possibility claims to a rather limited extent, it has recently undergone an ""empirical turn"", investigating justification strategies for modal claims based on empirical evidence – thus making it amenable to issues in the philosophy of science. The resources from modal epistemology that we are employing include conceptual distinctions, new perspectives, and novel justificatory strategies. With this approach, the symposium aims to achieve three goals. First, it aims to raise awareness of interesting philosophical issues relating to scientific practices involving possibility claims. Second, it advances the philosophical analysis of these issues. Finally, it showcases how drawing on modal epistemology can help philosophy of science in this matter.</p>","Scientific Models / Modeling","Key Ballroom 09","Hybrid Presentation","The (Un)Easily Possible Synthetic Biology?|Spaces of the Biologically Possible|Mapping Possibilities in Climate Science|Representing Possible Targets?||","Till Grüne-Yanoff, Philippe Verreault-Julien, Ylwa Sjölin Wirling, Rami Koskinen, Tarja Knuuttila","Tim Elmo Feiten","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Early philosophical reactions to the Earman-Norton version of the argument focused on articulating and defending versions of substantivalism that could avoid the dire conclusions of the hole argument. The new literature, by contrast, which has included contributions from mathematicians, physicists, and philosophers, has focused on what might be called \emph{non-metaphysical} resolutions of the dilemma posed by the argument. The purpose of this symposium is to bring together philosophers and physicists who have worked on different aspects of this new literature, to explore how the different strands---which have developed largely independently---relate to and may inform one another.</p>","Philosophy of Physics - space and time","Key Ballroom 10","In-Person Presentation","Mathematics, Metaphysics, and the Hole Argument: Then and Now|Patching up the Representation of Spacetime in General Relativity|Metaphysical Considerations after Resolving the Hole Dilemma without Metaphysics|Permutations and Charts: Is the Hole Argument a Puzzle about Reference?||","Robert Rynasiewicz, James Weatherall, Francesca Vidotto, James Ladyman, Clara Bradley","Rima Hussein","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Successful examples of targeted treatments in the context of certain cancers and rare diseases are often taken to illustrate the revolutionary potential of precision medicine in other contexts. This symposium critically examines the assumptions underlying this expectation. Precision medicine is often promoted as a unified solution to current challenges in health care without recognition of the complexities of the various contexts of implementation. One example is the ideal of ""patient empowerment"" in primary care, where risk information is envisioned to enable patients to take control over future health outcomes. This vision, however, presupposes quite significant epistemic assumptions, and implies a shift in the organization of health care systems. This includes changes in the relationship between doctors and patients, as well as in their respective roles and responsibilities. The symposium offers an overview of how precision medicine has developed as a promissory science, recently distancing itself from ""personalized medicine"", and calls for a calibration of expectations according to existing evidence of health benefits.</p>","Philosophy of Medicine","","Remote Presentation","Scoping Precision Medicine|Precision Medicine and the Ideal of Patient Empowerment|Impact of Precision Medicine on Physician-Patient Relationships|Personalized Medicine Wasn't Personal; Precision Medicine Isn't Precise ||","Jim Tabery, Sara Green, Paul Appelbaum, Kathryn Tabb","PSA Office,  Jessica Pfeifer,  Luciana Garbayo","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether we adopt a prospective approach and offer recommendations for what science and scientists ought to be doing, or a stance focused on the description of actual scientific practices and the identification of existing inequalities, issues of justice need to move from the periphery to the center in contemporary philosophy of science. This symposium will address this epistemic need, and will aim to jumpstart a more robust conversation about the relationship between science and justice. Questions to be addressed include: Can justice be the, or an, aim of science? How do scientists deal with injustices in specific contexts? How can scientists work to ensure science does not contribute to injustice? And what does a science for the purpose of justice look like? The four talks tackle these questions and canvas possible answers to them, drawing from a plurality of social-political theories- including both the liberal tradition and critical theory-regarding what counts as an injustice in science.</p>","Values in Science","","Remote Presentation","Institutions, Forethought, and Scientists’ Responsibility for Social Justice|Critical Theory for Science|The Limits of Democratizing Science:  When Scientists Should Ignore the Public|Epistemic severing and epistemic trademarking.

"55","Session","Current Debates on Statistical Modeling and Inference","2021-11-13","9:00:00","12:15:00","<p>Statistical methods play an essential role in an extremely wide range of human reasoning. From theorizing in the physical and social sciences to determining evidential standards in legal contexts, statistical methods are ubiquitous, and so are questions about their adequate application. As tools for making inferences that go beyond a given set of data, they are inherently a means of inductive, or ampliative reasoning, and so it is unsurprising that philosophers have used statistical frameworks to further our understanding of these topics. Yet statistical methods are undergoing considerable debate with important implications for standards of research across social and biological science. In the last decade many published results in the medical and social sciences have been found not to replicate. This has sparked debates about the very nature of statistical inference and modeling. Combining perspectives from philosophy, statistics, psychology, and economics, our symposium focuses on these recent debates. It will be a topical session building on Deborah Mayo's Statistical Inference as Severe Testing: How to Get Beyond the Statistics Wars (CUP, 2018), and a 2019 Summer Seminar on Philosophy of Statistics co-directed by D.

"110","Session","AAPT-PSA Teaching Hub","2021-11-11","8:30:00","10:00:00","<p data-pm-slice=""1 1 []"">Abstract: The American Association of Philosophy Teachers (AAPT) is an association that focuses on the advancement of the art of teaching philosophy. Recently, the AAPT has partnered with other philosophical associations to run ""Teaching Hubs"" at those conferences. Teaching Hubs aim to bring active, student-centered teaching discussions and resources to the wider audience of philosophy instructors. This AAPT-PSA Teaching Hub seeks to bring AAPT-style pedagogy to the problems facing the teaching of philosophy of science.</p><p>The AAPT-PSA Teaching Hub is a series of interactive workshops and conversations designed specifically for philosophers of science and created to celebrate teaching within the context of the PSA biannual meetings. Organized by the American Association of Philosophy Teachers, the Teaching Hub aims to offer a range of high quality and inclusive development opportunities that address the teaching of philosophy of science at all levels, pre-college though graduate school. This session first provides a brief introduction to AAPT Teaching Hubs, followed by two workshop sessions: (1) The Thinking Science project, which aims to bring philosophical questioning to science education for schoolchildren. This extension of the project covers various topics involving AI, big data and robotics. (2) ""Robust Classrooms: Redesigning Science Learning"" details an approach to teaching that scientific modeling necessarily involves choices and the integration of visual technology. The session leaders have implemented this teaching strategy through the modeling of COVID-19. Additionally, the session leaders will demonstrate one way to effectively integrate visual technology into a group project about modeling.</p><p><br /></p>","Teaching philosophy of science","","Remote Presentation","Introduction to the AAPT-PSA Teaching Hub|Thinking Science: Information Technology and People|Robust Classrooms: Redesigning Science Learning Environments|||","Melissa Jacquart, Vadim Keyser, Hannah Howland, Ellen Hart","PSA Office,  Melissa Jacquart,  Jessica Pfeifer","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"111","Session","Committee for Integrated HPS","2021-11-11","8:30:00","10:00:00","<p dir=""ltr"">Case Studies: Putting the H back in HPS</p><p><br /></p><p dir=""ltr"">One of the perennial themes in the field of ""integrated HPS"" is the question about the nature and role of case studies for historical and philosophical analyses of science. What philosophical lessons, if any, can we draw from examining specific historical events and processes? </p><p dir=""ltr"">In the decades after the historical turn of philosophy of science in the wake of Lakatos, Kuhn, Laudan, and others, HPS was associated with the notion that philosophical concepts and ideas should be tested against the historical record. Case studies were expected to probe the historical adequacy, and thus the relevance to science, of philosophical concepts and theories about science. </p><p dir=""ltr"">During the last decade or so, however, the notion that philosophical concepts and theories could be empirically tested has been cast into doubt. What could it mean to ""test"" philosophical concepts against the historical record? Is it really a ""test"" of a philosophical concept if we find an episode that fits with that concept? How can we prevent cherry-picking our cases? Should we study cases that could potentially refute our philosophical theories? What could the terms ""fit"" or ""refute"" even mean in this context? What can we learn from a single case study, or even a few case studies, about science tout court? And what are ""case studies"" anyway? </p><p dir=""ltr"">Yet, despite all these misgivings regarding the idea that we should test philosophy of science with cases, investigating actual scientific episodes remains a crucial part of HPS. In their attempts to find more appropriate characterizations of the nature and role of historical case studies for philosophy of science, scholars within the field, including Hasok Chang (2012) and Katherina Kinzel (2015), among others, have moved the discussion beyond the simple notion of ""testing philosophy with cases"". This session further examines the nature of case studies and their role for philosophical inquiry through illustration and systematic analysis. Three of the papers present historical episodes drawn from different fields of inquiry and different historical periods: the construction of a cervimeter to measure cervical dilation (Jackson); the application of Bohr's atomic model to helium (Kaveh); and research on scorpion suicide (Arnet). Each presenter utilizes the case study to consider broader philosophical issues: the concept of units of measurement (Jackson); predictive success (Kaveh); and continuity and change in scientific knowledge production (Arnet); to reflect on the question of how the historical material could help clarify the philosophical issues at stake. </p><p dir=""ltr"">The three concrete analyses are framed by a paper (Bolinska & Martin) and a commentary (Chang) which discuss the structure and functions of historical case studies more abstractly. Together, the five contributions to this session provide rich opportunities to think through questions such as: What are the distinctive features of philosophically informed case studies of past science? How strictly should our case studies adhere to the standards of professional history of science? What makes particular historical episodes good, fruitful, and suitable for philosophical analysis? What kinds of philosophical insights can be gained by engaging with historical cases, and might the work with cases perhaps constrain or limit philosophical analyses in certain ways? </p><p><br /></p><p dir=""ltr"">Kinzel, K., Narrative and evidence.

Third, we provide methodological resources to appraise how-possibly explanations in</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">economics.</p><p style=""line-height: 1;""><br /></p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">Topic description (991)</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">How we can learn about the world with highly idealized models has been a vexing philosophical</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">issue. These models often do not faithfully describe the world as it is, yet it also seems they are</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">not epistemically vacuous. Philosophers have started to draw attention to the modal features of</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">scientific modelling (e.g. Betz 2015; Bokulich 2014; Knuuttila and Koskinen 2020; Massimi</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">2019; Rice 2016; Shech and Gelfert 2019; Weisberg 2013). According to that growing body of</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">literature, scientists sometimes seek to establish possibility claims. For instance, biologists</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">synthesize potential organisms (Elowitz and Lim 2010) and physicists model impossible</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">perpetual motion machines (Feynman, Leighton, and Sands 2010) to further our understanding of</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">the world. They pursue the epistemic goals of science by inquiring into the possible and</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">impossible.</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">We observe a similar interest concerning economic models. They are sometimes said to describe</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">credible worlds (Sugden 2000, 2009), establish possibility claims to rebut impossibility ones</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">(Grüne-Yanoff 2009), or provide how-possibly explanations (Aydinonat 2007, 2008; Ylikoski</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">and Aydinonat 2014). All this draws attention to the modal features of economic modelling</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">(Hausman 1984; Rappaport 1986, 1989, 1998): economics pursues not only its aims by</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">investigating what is actual, but also what is possible. Moreover, while some philosophers of</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">economics are pessimistic about the capacities of economic models to accurately represent the</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">actual world and explain (Alexandrova and Northcott 2013), others have suggested that they</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">might fare better as representations of genuine possibilities (Grüne-Yanoff 2013; Verreault-</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">Julien 2017; Ylikoski and Aydinonat 2014), thus offering an alternative and nuanced vindication</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">of current economic modelling practices.</p><p style=""line-height: 1;""><br /></p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">The methodology of economics needs this nuance. Prediction and explanation are commonly</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">considered as the most important goals of economic modelling. Yet, typical accounts of</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">economic modelling that rely on representational adequacy and robustness as criteria for success</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">suggest that most economic models fail to achieve these goals (Aydinonat and Köksal 2019). It is</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">true that economic models often do not meet the decomposability assumptions needed for</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">minimalist accounts of idealization (Cartwright 2009; Grüne-Yanoff 2011) and that most of them</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">are not robust to many kinds of de-idealizations (Knuuttila and Morgan 2019). Thus, they are</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">unlikely candidates for providing good predictions or explanations. But it does not follow from</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">this that most economic modelling is deficient. The reason is that the dominant accounts of</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">economic modelling do not do much justice to practice of economic modelling and particularly</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">to its modal features. Before dismissing these practices as epistemically inert, one must invest</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">more effort in investigating the role models play in establishing modal claims and providing</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">how-possibly explanations.</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">However, we currently have a limited understanding of modal modelling. No systematic survey</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">of modal modelling practices in economics exists, and few proposals have been offered how to</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">categorize and systematize these practices. Nor are there clear analyses of the epistemic</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">contributions of economic modal modelling. Do they consist in how-possibly explanations that</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">have epistemic value in their own right, or do they indirectly contribute to how-actually</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">explanations, and only through that acquire value? Furthermore, we also lack methodological</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">criteria for assessing the quality of specific how-possibly explanations.</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">This session focusses on those modelling practices that relate to how-possibly explanations. It</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">consists of three papers that examine distinct features of how-possibly explanations in</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">economics. Each paper documents some specific modal modelling practices in economics,</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">ranging from central bank modelling through trade theory to modelling cooperation. Each paper</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">then analyses how these practices make a substantial epistemic contribution, and concludes by</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">identifying criteria for assessing the quality of these modal modelling practices.</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">The first paper focusses on models considered potential candidates for providing causal</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">explanations, as one finds them, e.g., in central bank multi-model platforms. When considered on</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">their own, these models merely provide 'thin' how-possibly explanations of little epistemic</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">value. Yet, in practice, these models are crucial for acquiring how-actually explanations. The</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">paper illustrates such practices by showing how the Bank of England integrates multiple how-</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">possibly models in its COMPASS platform, aiming at how-actually explanation of real-world </p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">phenomena, and it investigates the success conditions of such how-actually explanations in terms</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">of how well they facilitate reasoning about reliable intervention.</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">The second paper emphasizes that economists often make use of multiple models along with</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">other sources of information in their quest for explaining actual phenomena. Therefore,</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">individual models rarely function as explanantia. Rather, economists typically use a set of</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">models (each of them highly idealized) to construct a 'menu' of possible explanations,</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">viz. explanations whose truth isn't yet established. When doing so, they rely on a diversity of</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">models and sources of evidence. Determining the actual explanation is then a matter of</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">eliminating the possible candidate explanations and establishing the truth of the relevant</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">explanantia.</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">The third paper argues that the practice of providing 'mere' how-possibly explanations does not</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">entitle economists to formulate any just-so story they wish. It proposes a conceptual framework</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">that allows assessing 'good' from 'bad' how-possibly explanations. This conceptual framework</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">relies on two key distinctions: the first between how-actually and how-possibly explanations, the</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">second between epistemic and objective how-possibly explanations. It argues that both of these</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">latter categories afford their own epistemically relevant results, and both have the conceptual</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">resources to distinguish between good and bad models. The paper illustrates these arguments</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">with examples from trade theory, economic geography, and social cooperation.</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">With these three presentations, the session aims to further our understanding of how-possibly</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">explanations and modal modelling in economics. In particular, we pursue three goals. First, we</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">show that the practice of establishing modal claims is well entrenched in the modelling strategies</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">of economists, even those with an eye on policy. Second, we illuminate how how-possibly</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">explanations make substantial epistemic contributions, either by establishing relevant free-</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">standing modal claims or by facilitating, in conjunction with other sources of information, the</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">development of how-actually explanations of phenomena of interest. Third, we provide</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">methodological guidelines for assessing the quality of how-possibly explanations, thus showing</p><p style=""line-height: 1;"">that they are distinct from methodologically naive just-so stories.</p>","Philosophy of Economics","Key Ballroom 09","Hybrid Presentation","The Needle in the Haystack: Finding the Actual Amongst the Possible|Economic Models and Possible Explanation|How-Possibly Explanations in Economics: Anything Goes?|||","Till Grüne-Yanoff, Jennifer Jhun, N.

Science in all areas of research is characterized by open dialogue, conflicting arguments and multiple approaches in solving scientific problems. This image of science has disappeared from the public awareness for almost two years now. </p><p dir=""ltr"">In the first paper of this symposium, an analysis of a series of on line videos and the comments that follow them as well as a variety of published on line articles where politicians, scientists and citizens present their ideas about the COVID-19 crisis is being presented. Results show that certain sequences in the structure of language and arguments concerning the aspects of the nature of science are present in the way politicians, scientists and citizens present their approach towards the COVID-19 crisis. </p><p dir=""ltr"">On the one hand, those supporting the biopolitically accepted as correct agenda present minimum nature of the science content in their arguments, while completely miss the synthetic nature of science as a product and the nature of the evolution and the methodologies of science. Nevertheless, they overemphasize on elements concerning the nature of the science context and the interrelations between science and society that impose demands on scientific research and development coming from power centers and power figures of modern society, having a result on spreading bio-biased attitudes to the community. </p><p dir=""ltr"">On the other hand, scientists and citizens engaged in public on line dialogues, present high input of the nature of the science content, of the synthetic nature of science as a product and of the nature of the evolution and the methodologies of science. In this case, the nature of the science context and the nature of the interrelations between science and society are brought forward in order to express the suppression of theories and research results that disagree with the biopolitically accepted as correct agenda to the extent of science being censored, while bioethics arguments point out the necessity of discussing about the nature of attitudes and values expressed though and fostered by science. </p><p dir=""ltr"">In the second paper of the symposium, the case of Sweden is discussed. The Swedish authorities have referred heavily to 'evidence' and 'lack of evidence' when motivating the use or non-use of different regulations. For example, the Swedish state epidemiologist for a long time argued against the use of masks by the general public, due to lack of evidence of its usefulness to prevent the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. </p><p dir=""ltr"">The reference to evidence/lack of evidence has been praised as well as criticized in the general debate involving the general public, politicians as well as scientists. The relationship between policy decisions and scientific knowledge is always complex. </p><p dir=""ltr"">The debate on what actions should be taken in relation to COVID-19 would benefit from scientists, policy stakeholders, politicians and the general public clarifying pros and cons, risks and benefits, and the values guiding the choices between different possible actions. In addition, in issues such as what actions to take in relation to the COVID-19 virus, the situation is even more complex since ""how the world 'is'"" is subject to ongoing research – the evidence is not clear, nor is there agreement on what counts as evidence, or what constitutes reasonable evidence requirements. </p><p dir=""ltr"">The paper suggests that science education should learn from the ongoing pandemic and reconsider simplistic notions of 'evidence' and 'investigations' described in secondary science textbooks, where processes of science are described as formulating a hypothesis, planning and performing an investigation and drawing conclusions, while 'messy' research processes and the nature of ongoing research are often left out. In addition, the relationship between ongoing research, evidence, and policy decisions should be discussed in more detail than what is usually the case, due to its importance for citizenship and everyday life. </p><p dir=""ltr"">The third paper of the symposium discusses the fact that many individuals and students in particular, often do not have the tools to discern quality scientific information from tentative or poor quality information. They often fail to recognize pseudoscience, false information, or propaganda. Therefore, key foundational pedagogical concepts that are needed to develop the ability to evaluate scientific information are proposed such as: a) how inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning work together to build scientific knowledge, b) how one can categorize types of scientific knowledge based on their tentativeness, c) how argument and evidence are codified by citations and referencing, d) how peer-review, publishing, and review articles are crucial in developing scientific consensus and e) how to find and access quality science information.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In the fourth paper of this symposium, the discussion focuses on the demand from society towards science education researchers to make proposals for digital educational material and teaching strategies that would help teachers understand and then be able to help their students learn what a virus triggered disease is and what medical research has to offer to tackle it. </p><p dir=""ltr"">The need for a logical, distant from the current moment, objective approach and presentation in digital narratives created about diseases, their medicines and their vaccines, is presented coupled with the challenge designers and developers of digital narratives face to make an emotional over-ride, that is to find one or more tricks or perspectives that distract the audience from getting too emotionally involved. </p><p dir=""ltr"">A digital narrative is presented in this paper that has been created based on history of science and history of medicine about diseases and attempts to point out elements of the nature of science about disease and treatment. </p><p dir=""ltr"">The analysis of research data coming from interviews with teachers and students shows the impact of the developed digital narrative and opens the discussion on the educational demands of teachers and students for digital educational material and teaching approaches about diseases, medicines and vaccines especially in the current times when digital science narratives contribute to the on-line spread of information to citizens.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In the fifth paper of this symposium, attention is brought to the importance to identify what content is privileged around health and disease in science curricula, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, pointing out the urgent task to help science teachers move from information to knowledge enabling action, exploring a multi-causal and multi-referential approach conveyed through narratives. The potential of the narrative format is examined in order to provide context, information and relations for students to explain aspects of pandemics from the past, present and future. </p><p dir=""ltr"">Current education seems in competition with circulation of information facilitated by new technologies. The problem is that this ""non-processed"" information serves for little more than being used in non-productive ways. </p><p dir=""ltr"">In this scenario, how can schools take profit of their position in society? </p><p dir=""ltr"">Is school science preparing students to understand the links between ecosystemic degradation and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2? </p><p dir=""ltr"">How can ""standard"" scientific content cope with socio-scientific issues such as whether ""generalist"" preventive measures are applicable in complex and sensitive contexts? </p><p dir=""ltr"">What is the robustness of these ""epistemic"" operations based on a list of biomedical data on COVID-19? </p><p dir=""ltr"">The paper examines the potential of scientific narratives to provide context, information and relations necessary for students to explain through theoretical models key aspects of pandemics aligning with the incorporation of an ""integrated view"" into school science and using narratives as a powerful vehicle to implement it in science classrooms.</p>","","","Remote Presentation","Nature of Science in the Public Discussion between Politicians, Scientists and Citizens in the Era of Biopolitics|The Notion of Evidence in Policy Discourse on Covid19 – Implications for Science Education|Key Pedagogical Concepts for Teaching Students about Scientific Knowledge |Multi-Referential Narratives on Epidemics as a Tool for Critical Science Education|Creating Digital Narratives for Science Education about Diseases, Medicines and Vaccines|","Fanny Seroglou, Lena Hansson, Lori Maramante, Agustín Adúriz-Bravo, Anna Letsi","PSA Office,  Fanny Seroglou,  Jessica Pfeifer","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of small genetic variants that are statistically associated with complex traits such as intelligence, schizophrenia, and depression. Because effect sizes of individual variants are miniscule, researchers are now creating polygenic scores which sum the total effects of all statistically associated genetic variants. It is commonplace for practitioners in the sciences to refer to SNPs and polygenic scores as 'causal determinants' of traits of interest – but are these philosophically contentions interpretations justified? The goal of this symposium is to bring together an interdisciplinary team of scientists and philosophers to address old questions about causality and genetics in light of cutting edge technological advancements.</p>","Causality","Key Ballroom 03","Hybrid Presentation","Determining Genetic and Environmental Causes: the Case of Mendelian Randomization |Making Sense of SNP Heritability|Composition, Causation, Mechanism, and Genetic Explanation of Psychological Entities|Vera Causae in Behavior Genetics||","Lucas Matthews, Jonathan Livengood, Kate Lynch, Eric Turkheimer","Stephen Downes","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
