This symposium aims to articulate a framework for understanding how biological mechanisms are controlled. The first contributions articulate insights about control by theoretical biologists and cyberneticists in the mid-20th century that have not been fully incorporated into philosophical thinking about mechanisms. One critical insight is that controlled mechanisms require flexible components on which other mechanisms, control mechanisms, can operate. A second is that these control mechanisms are responsive to conditions in the organism or its environment so as to alter flexible components in the controlled mechanisms so that they operate in ways needed by the organism. The later contributions focus on examples of research on control mechanisms, investigating how this research exhibits both similarities and differences to the accounts of mechanism discovery that focus on controlled mechanisms.</p>","track":"Mechanisms","venue":"","format":"Remote Presentation","subs":"Can Control be Accounted for on a Mechanistic Picture?|Basic Forms of Control in Multicellular Systems|Discovering Control Mechanisms Operative on Cytoplasmic Dyneins|||","authors":"William Bechtel, Leonardo Bich, Jason Winning","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"24","type":"Session","name":"Distinctions within Causation: Irreversibility, Coherence, Invariance and Machine-Likeness","date":"2021-11-11","start":"13:00:00","end":"15:00:00","abstract":"<p>Research in philosophy of causation has traditionally focused on the fundamental question of how to distinguish causation from correlation.

There is thus a need to address both the conservation and adaptation aspects in the cross-disciplinary transfer of models and their associated knowledge.

Second, there is some tension between our best contemporary theories of representation in philosophy, with their rich foundation of ancillary notions (biological function, sender-receiver architectures, causal-informational connections or asymmetries, structural correspondence, etc.); and actual appeals to representation in science, more austere, and apparently based only on the existence of correlation between neural and worldly variables. </p><p> </p><p> We aim to shed light on these central issues in the philosophy of cognitive science by examining the structure of austere conceptions of representation and information.

With this approach, the symposium aims to achieve three goals. First, it aims to raise awareness of interesting philosophical issues relating to scientific practices involving possibility claims.

One example is the ideal of \"patient empowerment\" in primary care, where risk information is envisioned to enable patients to take control over future health outcomes.

From theorizing in the physical and social sciences to determining evidential standards in legal contexts, statistical methods are ubiquitous, and so are questions about their adequate application. As tools for making inferences that go beyond a given set of data, they are inherently a means of inductive, or ampliative reasoning, and so it is unsurprising that philosophers have used statistical frameworks to further our understanding of these topics. Yet statistical methods are undergoing considerable debate with important implications for standards of research across social and biological science. In the last decade many published results in the medical and social sciences have been found not to replicate. This has sparked debates about the very nature of statistical inference and modeling. Combining perspectives from philosophy, statistics, psychology, and economics, our symposium focuses on these recent debates.

Today, cognitive scientists are beginning to grapple with Deep Neural Nets, perhaps the most impressive and difficult to understand advances in computing thus far. The striking success of DNNs suggests that perhaps there are deep similarities between them and the human mind. However, DNNs display bizarre behaviors and their inner workings are (allegedly) inscrutable, which would seem to undermine their value as a model of the mind. </p><p>In this symposium, we will examine the status of machine learning models of cognition. First, supposing that the analogy is a probative one, we suggest that it sheds light on traditional philosophical controversies about concepts. Second, we will critically examine the evidence from adversarial examples that has been taken undermine the similarity between human and machine concepts. Lastly, we will discuss how tools used to investigate human minds can break open the \"black box\" of DNNs.</p><p>This investigation will introduce philosophers of science to cutting edge work in machine learning and cognitive science, and provide a fascinating case study of the use of model systems in science.</p>","track":"Computer Simulation","venue":"Key Ballroom 10","format":"Hybrid Presentation","subs":"Taking a Machine’s Perspective|Machine Learning and Conceptual Complexity|Functional Intelligibility and Neural Network Models of the Brain|Interpreting Deep Learning's Susceptibility to Adversarial Examples|Learning Incommensurate Concepts |","authors":"Hayley Clatterbuck, Cameron Buckner, Jens Kipper, Chaz Firestone, Rosa Cao","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"57","type":"Session","name":"The Fundamental Physical Constants: Knowledge and Measurement","date":"2021-11-14","start":"9:00:00","end":"11:45:00","abstract":"<p>High-precision measurements of the fundamental physical constants show promise as a new source of insights regarding the nature of scientific knowledge. The consistent determination of dozens of fundamental constants provides the most stringent tests of current physical theories. Despite the remarkable success of these measurements, philosophers have not yet focused sufficient attention on the reasons for this success and the nature of the knowledge that emerges out of it. The aim of this symposium is to explore the nature of this knowledge by bringing together the perspectives of philosophy of physics, the philosophy of scientific methodology, and the philosophy of measurement. Among other topics, the symposium will examine the nature of scientific evidence emerging from precision measurement of physical constants in quantum electrodynamics and cosmology; provide new insights into the nature of scientific units and their connection to physical constants; and show how the precision measurement of physical constants can provide strategies for resolving methodological conundrums.</p>","track":"Measurement","venue":"","format":"Remote Presentation","subs":"Disrupting Zanzibars: The Epistemic Function of High Precision Divergence|The Role of Fundamental Constants in the International System of Units (SI)|The Interlinking Role of the Fine Structure Constant|Trouble with Hubble: Status of Big Bang Models|Fundamental Constants and Quantum Field Theory|","authors":"Teru Miyake, Alistair Isaac, Chris Smeenk, Adam Koberinski, Susan Sterrett","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"58","type":"Session","name":"The Sciences of Sexual Desire","date":"2021-11-14","start":"9:00:00","end":"11:45:00","abstract":"<p>The sciences of sexual desire range from anthropology to zoology, and include genetics, immunology, physiology, sociology, statistics, economics, psychology, psychiatry, and evolutionary biology. There are numerous philosophical issues pertaining to the scientific study of sexual desire, including conceptual, methodological, ontological, moral, and political questions. This symposium will ask: is low sexual desire a genuine disease? What is a 'sexuality', and how many in fact are there? How should we interpret the empirical evidence pertaining to alleged sex-differences in sexual desire? Should some topics of research about our sexual desires be prohibited on normative grounds?

The PSA Public Forum invites interested people to join a conversation about what led to scientific predictions of changes in the Chesapeake Bay and how and why they got it so right? What goes into modeling the complex factors that have led to the rise of sea level, the warming water, and extreme weather that impact the wildlife on land and the fish and shellfish in the water? The event will feature three panelists (a philosopher, a historian, and a scientist) and a moderator, who is also a philosopher. Each panelist will make brief remarks highlighting philosophical issues related to how science works, why it succeeded in predicting changes in the Chesapeake Bay, and how it avoided mistakes that would have led to wrong projections. This will be followed by an open discussion between the three panelists facilitated by the moderator, and then the moderator will invite questions from the audience.

Recently, the AAPT has partnered with other philosophical associations to run \"Teaching Hubs\" at those conferences. Teaching Hubs aim to bring active, student-centered teaching discussions and resources to the wider audience of philosophy instructors. This AAPT-PSA Teaching Hub seeks to bring AAPT-style pedagogy to the problems facing the teaching of philosophy of science.</p><p>The AAPT-PSA Teaching Hub is a series of interactive workshops and conversations designed specifically for philosophers of science and created to celebrate teaching within the context of the PSA biannual meetings. Organized by the American Association of Philosophy Teachers, the Teaching Hub aims to offer a range of high quality and inclusive development opportunities that address the teaching of philosophy of science at all levels, pre-college though graduate school. This session first provides a brief introduction to AAPT Teaching Hubs, followed by two workshop sessions: (1) The Thinking Science project, which aims to bring philosophical questioning to science education for schoolchildren. This extension of the project covers various topics involving AI, big data and robotics. (2) \"Robust Classrooms: Redesigning Science Learning\" details an approach to teaching that scientific modeling necessarily involves choices and the integration of visual technology. The session leaders have implemented this teaching strategy through the modeling of COVID-19. Additionally, the session leaders will demonstrate one way to effectively integrate visual technology into a group project about modeling.</p><p><br /></p>","track":"Teaching philosophy of science","venue":"Key Ballroom 11","format":"Remote Presentation","subs":"Introduction to the AAPT-PSA Teaching Hub|Thinking Science: Information Technology and People|Robust Classrooms: Redesigning Science Learning Environments|||","authors":"Melissa Jacquart, Vadim Keyser, Hannah Howland, Ellen Hart","moderator":"Melissa Jacquart","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"111","type":"Session","name":"Committee for Integrated HPS","date":"2021-11-11","start":"8:30:00","end":"10:00:00","abstract":"<p dir=\"ltr\">Case Studies: Putting the H back in HPS</p><p><br /></p><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the perennial themes in the field of \"integrated HPS\" is the question about the nature and role of case studies for historical and philosophical analyses of science. What philosophical lessons, if any, can we draw from examining specific historical events and processes? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the decades after the historical turn of philosophy of science in the wake of Lakatos, Kuhn, Laudan, and others, HPS was associated with the notion that philosophical concepts and ideas should be tested against the historical record. Case studies were expected to probe the historical adequacy, and thus the relevance to science, of philosophical concepts and theories about science. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">During the last decade or so, however, the notion that philosophical concepts and theories could be empirically tested has been cast into doubt. What could it mean to \"test\" philosophical concepts against the historical record? Is it really a \"test\" of a philosophical concept if we find an episode that fits with that concept? How can we prevent cherry-picking our cases? Should we study cases that could potentially refute our philosophical theories? What could the terms \"fit\" or \"refute\" even mean in this context? What can we learn from a single case study, or even a few case studies, about science tout court? And what are \"case studies\" anyway? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yet, despite all these misgivings regarding the idea that we should test philosophy of science with cases, investigating actual scientific episodes remains a crucial part of HPS. In their attempts to find more appropriate characterizations of the nature and role of historical case studies for philosophy of science, scholars within the field, including Hasok Chang (2012) and Katherina Kinzel (2015), among others, have moved the discussion beyond the simple notion of \"testing philosophy with cases\". This session further examines the nature of case studies and their role for philosophical inquiry through illustration and systematic analysis. Three of the papers present historical episodes drawn from different fields of inquiry and different historical periods: the construction of a cervimeter to measure cervical dilation (Jackson); the application of Bohr's atomic model to helium (Kaveh); and research on scorpion suicide (Arnet). Each presenter utilizes the case study to consider broader philosophical issues: the concept of units of measurement (Jackson); predictive success (Kaveh); and continuity and change in scientific knowledge production (Arnet); to reflect on the question of how the historical material could help clarify the philosophical issues at stake. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The three concrete analyses are framed by a paper (Bolinska & Martin) and a commentary (Chang) which discuss the structure and functions of historical case studies more abstractly. Together, the five contributions to this session provide rich opportunities to think through questions such as: What are the distinctive features of philosophically informed case studies of past science? How strictly should our case studies adhere to the standards of professional history of science? What makes particular historical episodes good, fruitful, and suitable for philosophical analysis? What kinds of philosophical insights can be gained by engaging with historical cases, and might the work with cases perhaps constrain or limit philosophical analyses in certain ways? </p><p><br /></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kinzel, K., Narrative and evidence.

Second, we illuminate how how-possibly explanations relate to economic</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">modelling practices and how they are used to acquire how-actually explanations of phenomena</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of interest. Third, we provide methodological resources to appraise how-possibly explanations in</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economics.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\"><br /></p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">Topic description (991)</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">How we can learn about the world with highly idealized models has been a vexing philosophical</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">issue. These models often do not faithfully describe the world as it is, yet it also seems they are</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">not epistemically vacuous. Philosophers have started to draw attention to the modal features of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">scientific modelling (e.g. Betz 2015; Bokulich 2014; Knuuttila and Koskinen 2020; Massimi</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">2019; Rice 2016; Shech and Gelfert 2019; Weisberg 2013). According to that growing body of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">literature, scientists sometimes seek to establish possibility claims. For instance, biologists</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">synthesize potential organisms (Elowitz and Lim 2010) and physicists model impossible</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">perpetual motion machines (Feynman, Leighton, and Sands 2010) to further our understanding of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">the world. They pursue the epistemic goals of science by inquiring into the possible and</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">impossible.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">We observe a similar interest concerning economic models. They are sometimes said to describe</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">credible worlds (Sugden 2000, 2009), establish possibility claims to rebut impossibility ones</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">(Grüne-Yanoff 2009), or provide how-possibly explanations (Aydinonat 2007, 2008; Ylikoski</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">and Aydinonat 2014). All this draws attention to the modal features of economic modelling</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">(Hausman 1984; Rappaport 1986, 1989, 1998): economics pursues not only its aims by</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">investigating what is actual, but also what is possible. Moreover, while some philosophers of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economics are pessimistic about the capacities of economic models to accurately represent the</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">actual world and explain (Alexandrova and Northcott 2013), others have suggested that they</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">might fare better as representations of genuine possibilities (Grüne-Yanoff 2013; Verreault-</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">Julien 2017; Ylikoski and Aydinonat 2014), thus offering an alternative and nuanced vindication</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of current economic modelling practices.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\"><br /></p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">The methodology of economics needs this nuance. Prediction and explanation are commonly</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">considered as the most important goals of economic modelling. Yet, typical accounts of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economic modelling that rely on representational adequacy and robustness as criteria for success</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">suggest that most economic models fail to achieve these goals (Aydinonat and Köksal 2019). It is</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">true that economic models often do not meet the decomposability assumptions needed for</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">minimalist accounts of idealization (Cartwright 2009; Grüne-Yanoff 2011) and that most of them</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">are not robust to many kinds of de-idealizations (Knuuttila and Morgan 2019). Thus, they are</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">unlikely candidates for providing good predictions or explanations. But it does not follow from</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">this that most economic modelling is deficient. The reason is that the dominant accounts of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economic modelling do not do much justice to practice of economic modelling and particularly</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">to its modal features. Before dismissing these practices as epistemically inert, one must invest</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">more effort in investigating the role models play in establishing modal claims and providing</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">how-possibly explanations.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">However, we currently have a limited understanding of modal modelling. No systematic survey</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of modal modelling practices in economics exists, and few proposals have been offered how to</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">categorize and systematize these practices. Nor are there clear analyses of the epistemic</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">contributions of economic modal modelling. Do they consist in how-possibly explanations that</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">have epistemic value in their own right, or do they indirectly contribute to how-actually</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanations, and only through that acquire value? Furthermore, we also lack methodological</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">criteria for assessing the quality of specific how-possibly explanations.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">This session focusses on those modelling practices that relate to how-possibly explanations. It</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">consists of three papers that examine distinct features of how-possibly explanations in</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economics. Each paper documents some specific modal modelling practices in economics,</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">ranging from central bank modelling through trade theory to modelling cooperation. Each paper</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">then analyses how these practices make a substantial epistemic contribution, and concludes by</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">identifying criteria for assessing the quality of these modal modelling practices.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">The first paper focusses on models considered potential candidates for providing causal</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanations, as one finds them, e.g., in central bank multi-model platforms. When considered on</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">their own, these models merely provide 'thin' how-possibly explanations of little epistemic</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">value. Yet, in practice, these models are crucial for acquiring how-actually explanations. The</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">paper illustrates such practices by showing how the Bank of England integrates multiple how-</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">possibly models in its COMPASS platform, aiming at how-actually explanation of real-world </p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">phenomena, and it investigates the success conditions of such how-actually explanations in terms</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of how well they facilitate reasoning about reliable intervention.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">The second paper emphasizes that economists often make use of multiple models along with</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">other sources of information in their quest for explaining actual phenomena. Therefore,</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">individual models rarely function as explanantia. Rather, economists typically use a set of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">models (each of them highly idealized) to construct a 'menu' of possible explanations,</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">viz. explanations whose truth isn't yet established. When doing so, they rely on a diversity of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">models and sources of evidence. Determining the actual explanation is then a matter of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">eliminating the possible candidate explanations and establishing the truth of the relevant</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanantia.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">The third paper argues that the practice of providing 'mere' how-possibly explanations does not</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">entitle economists to formulate any just-so story they wish. It proposes a conceptual framework</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">that allows assessing 'good' from 'bad' how-possibly explanations. This conceptual framework</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">relies on two key distinctions: the first between how-actually and how-possibly explanations, the</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">second between epistemic and objective how-possibly explanations. It argues that both of these</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">latter categories afford their own epistemically relevant results, and both have the conceptual</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">resources to distinguish between good and bad models. The paper illustrates these arguments</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">with examples from trade theory, economic geography, and social cooperation.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">With these three presentations, the session aims to further our understanding of how-possibly</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanations and modal modelling in economics. In particular, we pursue three goals. First, we</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">show that the practice of establishing modal claims is well entrenched in the modelling strategies</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of economists, even those with an eye on policy. Second, we illuminate how how-possibly</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanations make substantial epistemic contributions, either by establishing relevant free-</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">standing modal claims or by facilitating, in conjunction with other sources of information, the</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">development of how-actually explanations of phenomena of interest. Third, we provide</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">methodological guidelines for assessing the quality of how-possibly explanations, thus showing</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">that they are distinct from methodologically naive just-so stories.</p>","track":"Philosophy of Economics","venue":"Key Ballroom 09","format":"Hybrid Presentation","subs":"The Needle in the Haystack: Finding the Actual Amongst the Possible|Economic Models and Possible Explanation|How-Possibly Explanations in Economics: Anything Goes?|||","authors":"Till Grüne-Yanoff, Jennifer Jhun, N.

Science in all areas of research is characterized by open dialogue, conflicting arguments and multiple approaches in solving scientific problems. This image of science has disappeared from the public awareness for almost two years now. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the first paper of this symposium, an analysis of a series of on line videos and the comments that follow them as well as a variety of published on line articles where politicians, scientists and citizens present their ideas about the COVID-19 crisis is being presented. Results show that certain sequences in the structure of language and arguments concerning the aspects of the nature of science are present in the way politicians, scientists and citizens present their approach towards the COVID-19 crisis. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the one hand, those supporting the biopolitically accepted as correct agenda present minimum nature of the science content in their arguments, while completely miss the synthetic nature of science as a product and the nature of the evolution and the methodologies of science. Nevertheless, they overemphasize on elements concerning the nature of the science context and the interrelations between science and society that impose demands on scientific research and development coming from power centers and power figures of modern society, having a result on spreading bio-biased attitudes to the community. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, scientists and citizens engaged in public on line dialogues, present high input of the nature of the science content, of the synthetic nature of science as a product and of the nature of the evolution and the methodologies of science. In this case, the nature of the science context and the nature of the interrelations between science and society are brought forward in order to express the suppression of theories and research results that disagree with the biopolitically accepted as correct agenda to the extent of science being censored, while bioethics arguments point out the necessity of discussing about the nature of attitudes and values expressed though and fostered by science. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the second paper of the symposium, the case of Sweden is discussed. The Swedish authorities have referred heavily to 'evidence' and 'lack of evidence' when motivating the use or non-use of different regulations. For example, the Swedish state epidemiologist for a long time argued against the use of masks by the general public, due to lack of evidence of its usefulness to prevent the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The reference to evidence/lack of evidence has been praised as well as criticized in the general debate involving the general public, politicians as well as scientists. The relationship between policy decisions and scientific knowledge is always complex. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The debate on what actions should be taken in relation to COVID-19 would benefit from scientists, policy stakeholders, politicians and the general public clarifying pros and cons, risks and benefits, and the values guiding the choices between different possible actions. In addition, in issues such as what actions to take in relation to the COVID-19 virus, the situation is even more complex since \"how the world 'is'\" is subject to ongoing research – the evidence is not clear, nor is there agreement on what counts as evidence, or what constitutes reasonable evidence requirements. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The paper suggests that science education should learn from the ongoing pandemic and reconsider simplistic notions of 'evidence' and 'investigations' described in secondary science textbooks, where processes of science are described as formulating a hypothesis, planning and performing an investigation and drawing conclusions, while 'messy' research processes and the nature of ongoing research are often left out. In addition, the relationship between ongoing research, evidence, and policy decisions should be discussed in more detail than what is usually the case, due to its importance for citizenship and everyday life. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The third paper of the symposium discusses the fact that many individuals and students in particular, often do not have the tools to discern quality scientific information from tentative or poor quality information. They often fail to recognize pseudoscience, false information, or propaganda. Therefore, key foundational pedagogical concepts that are needed to develop the ability to evaluate scientific information are proposed such as: a) how inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning work together to build scientific knowledge, b) how one can categorize types of scientific knowledge based on their tentativeness, c) how argument and evidence are codified by citations and referencing, d) how peer-review, publishing, and review articles are crucial in developing scientific consensus and e) how to find and access quality science information.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the fourth paper of this symposium, the discussion focuses on the demand from society towards science education researchers to make proposals for digital educational material and teaching strategies that would help teachers understand and then be able to help their students learn what a virus triggered disease is and what medical research has to offer to tackle it. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The need for a logical, distant from the current moment, objective approach and presentation in digital narratives created about diseases, their medicines and their vaccines, is presented coupled with the challenge designers and developers of digital narratives face to make an emotional over-ride, that is to find one or more tricks or perspectives that distract the audience from getting too emotionally involved. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">A digital narrative is presented in this paper that has been created based on history of science and history of medicine about diseases and attempts to point out elements of the nature of science about disease and treatment. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The analysis of research data coming from interviews with teachers and students shows the impact of the developed digital narrative and opens the discussion on the educational demands of teachers and students for digital educational material and teaching approaches about diseases, medicines and vaccines especially in the current times when digital science narratives contribute to the on-line spread of information to citizens.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the fifth paper of this symposium, attention is brought to the importance to identify what content is privileged around health and disease in science curricula, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, pointing out the urgent task to help science teachers move from information to knowledge enabling action, exploring a multi-causal and multi-referential approach conveyed through narratives. The potential of the narrative format is examined in order to provide context, information and relations for students to explain aspects of pandemics from the past, present and future. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Current education seems in competition with circulation of information facilitated by new technologies. The problem is that this \"non-processed\" information serves for little more than being used in non-productive ways. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In this scenario, how can schools take profit of their position in society? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Is school science preparing students to understand the links between ecosystemic degradation and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">How can \"standard\" scientific content cope with socio-scientific issues such as whether \"generalist\" preventive measures are applicable in complex and sensitive contexts? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">What is the robustness of these \"epistemic\" operations based on a list of biomedical data on COVID-19? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The paper examines the potential of scientific narratives to provide context, information and relations necessary for students to explain through theoretical models key aspects of pandemics aligning with the incorporation of an \"integrated view\" into school science and using narratives as a powerful vehicle to implement it in science classrooms.</p>","track":"","venue":"","format":"Remote Presentation","subs":"Nature of Science in the Public Discussion between Politicians, Scientists and Citizens in the Era of Biopolitics|The Notion of Evidence in Policy Discourse on Covid19 – Implications for Science Education|Key Pedagogical Concepts for Teaching Students about Scientific Knowledge |Multi-Referential Narratives on Epidemics as a Tool for Critical Science Education|Creating Digital Narratives for Science Education about Diseases, Medicines and Vaccines|","authors":"Fanny Seroglou, Lena Hansson, Lori Maramante, Agustín Adúriz-Bravo, Anna Letsi","moderator":"Fanny Seroglou","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"123","type":"Break","name":"Childcare","date":"2021-11-11","start":"8:00:00","end":"18:00:00","abstract":"<p>With support from the Ann Johnson Institute for Science, Technology, and Society</p><p><img src=\"https://dryfta-assets.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/assets/psa2020/editorimages/1633970528aji4stssc.edu.png\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib fr-shadow\" /></p>","track":"","venue":"Douglass","format":"","subs":"","authors":"","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"124","type":"Break","name":"Childcare","date":"2021-11-12","start":"8:30:00","end":"18:00:00","abstract":"","track":"","venue":"Douglass","format":"","subs":"","authors":"","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"125","type":"Break","name":"Childcare","date":"2021-11-13","start":"8:30:00","end":"18:00:00","abstract":"","track":"","venue":"Douglass","format":"","subs":"","authors":"","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"126","type":"Break","name":"Childcare","date":"2021-11-14","start":"8:30:00","end":"12:00:00","abstract":"","track":"","venue":"Douglass","format":"","subs":"","authors":"","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"127","type":"Session","name":"Poster Forum and Reception","date":"2021-11-12","start":"18:30:00","end":"20:30:00","abstract":"","track":"","venue":"Key Ballroom South Foyer","format":"","subs":"Vetting Theoretical Virtues: Parsimony and the Framing Effect|For Topological Explanations and Against Mechanistic Fundamentality|Epistemic Principles of Astrobiology|Interactionalism about Black Hole Thermodynamics: Between Functionalism and Operationalism|The Missing Link in Inferences with Climate Networks|The Replication Crisis and Philosophy|Belief, Acceptance, and Pragmatic Equivalence in Scientific Representation|Towards a Problem-Solving Account of Scientific Representation |Good Reasons to Reject Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)|Normality and Conjoined Causal Isomorphs|The Metaphysical and Empirical Criteria in Newton’s Hypotheses|Choosing Empirical Methods: Challenging the Epistemic Superiority of Manipulation-Based Inquiry|A Complementarity Model for Data-Intensive and Hypothesis-Driven Science |Smoking Guns: Using “True Crime” Podcasts to Teach Philosophy of Science to General Education Students. |Equivalence, Which Equivalence?

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of small genetic variants that are statistically associated with complex traits such as intelligence, schizophrenia, and depression. Because effect sizes of individual variants are miniscule, researchers are now creating polygenic scores which sum the total effects of all statistically associated genetic variants. It is commonplace for practitioners in the sciences to refer to SNPs and polygenic scores as 'causal determinants' of traits of interest – but are these philosophically contentions interpretations justified? The goal of this symposium is to bring together an interdisciplinary team of scientists and philosophers to address old questions about causality and genetics in light of cutting edge technological advancements.</p>","track":"Causality","venue":"Key Ballroom 03","format":"Hybrid Presentation","subs":"Determining Genetic and Environmental Causes: the Case of Mendelian Randomization |Making Sense of SNP Heritability|Composition, Causation, Mechanism, and Genetic Explanation of Psychological Entities|Vera Causae in Behavior Genetics||","authors":"Lucas Matthews, Jonathan Livengood, Kate Lynch, Eric Turkheimer","moderator":"Stephen Downes","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"143","type":"Break","name":"Opening Reception","date":"2021-11-11","start":"17:15:00","end":"18:45:00","abstract":"<div style=\"background: #07077c; padding: 20px;\"><p style=\"color: white;\">Sponsored by</p><p><a href=\"https://www.centerphilsci.pitt.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.centerphilsci.pitt.edu/wp-content/themes/boxpress/assets/img/dist/logo-white.png\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" /></a></p><p style=\"background:#e98d03; color: white; padding: 15px 25px; display: inline-block;\"><a href=\"https://psa2020.dryfta.com/exhibitors/sponsors/sponsor/detail/1/center-for-philosophy-of-science-university-of-pittsburgh\" style=\"color: inherit;\">Learn More</a></p></div>","track":"","venue":"Key Ballroom South Foyer","format":"","subs":"","authors":"","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"146","type":"Session","name":"UPSS Session","date":"2021-11-12","start":"10:45:00","end":"12:15:00","abstract":"","track":"","venue":"Key Ballroom 11","format":"Hybrid Presentation","subs":"The New ‘Biosocial’ Race: Local and Global Challenges for Race in Postgenomics|Biodiversity vs. Paleodiversity Measurements: the Incommensurability Problem|Epistemic Advantage on the Margin: a Network Standpoint Epistemology|||","authors":"Federica Bocchi, Jingyi Wu, Azita Chellappoo","moderator":"Jennifer McDonald","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"147","type":"Session","name":"Probability and Statistics II","date":"2021-11-12","start":"10:45:00","end":"12:15:00","abstract":"","track":"Probability and Statistics","venue":"Key Ballroom 12","format":"In-Person Presentation","subs":"Imprecise Chance and Chance-Credence Coordination|Openness and Reproducibility from a Model-Centric View|Pursuit of Predictive Accuracy: Seven Worries|||","authors":"Luke Fenton-Glynn, Hanti Lin, Bert Baumgaertner","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""},{"id":"148","type":"Break","name":"Closing Reception","date":"2021-11-13","start":"20:00:00","end":"21:00:00","abstract":"","track":"","venue":"Key Ballroom South Foyer","format":"","subs":"","authors":"","moderator":"","field14":"","field15":"","field16":"","field17":"","field18":"","field19":"","field20":"","field21":"","field22":"","field23":"","field24":"","field25":"","field26":""}]
