More specifically, we address this general question from three perspectives: theories of valid inductive inference, understanding Bayesian models as scientific models, and comparing Bayesian models to competitors. At the end, we combine these perspectives to explain the popularity of Bayesianism in various fields of philosophy and science.</p>",

This has produced significant insights into the kinds of causal knowledge that neuroscientific experiments can deliver. However, the focus on explanation has also arguably had a distorting effect on the field. For example, it has encouraged the tendency to lump together or subsume all neuroscientific techniques and models of interest under the heading of explanation (see, for example, debates over whether topological or dynamical \"explanations\" of neural phenomena are really deserving of the name). But the epistemic terrain of neuroscience is far more varied and interesting than this, and it includes knowledge-producing practices that go beyond explanation. Neuroscientific practice includes the development of tools and experimental systems, data analytic techniques, exploratory investigations, formal descriptive frameworks, predictive simulations, and new laboratory phenomena, as well as a host of clinical translational applications. While these may contribute to explanation, they are nevertheless distinct from it. This symposium aims to articulate the social, material, and normative characteristics of these non-explanatory neuroscientific practices, and to chart their interrelations.</p>",

Control plays a critical role since, in living organisms, mechanisms typically perform their activities only when they are required to build or maintain the organism and so must do so in different ways under different conditions. This symposium aims to articulate a framework for understanding how biological mechanisms are controlled. The first contributions articulate insights about control by theoretical biologists and cyberneticists in the mid-20th century that have not been fully incorporated into philosophical thinking about mechanisms. One critical insight is that controlled mechanisms require flexible components on which other mechanisms, control mechanisms, can operate. A second is that these control mechanisms are responsive to conditions in the organism or its environment so as to alter flexible components in the controlled mechanisms so that they operate in ways needed by the organism. The later contributions focus on examples of research on control mechanisms, investigating how this research exhibits both similarities and differences to the accounts of mechanism discovery that focus on controlled mechanisms.</p>",

These features include: the degree to which causal relationships exhibit (i) [ir]reversibility, (ii) invariance, (iii) coherence, and (iv) machine-likeness. These features are examined in four separate talks (one co-authored), provided by four philosophers and one scientist, who all conduct research on causation and causal reasoning. Each of these talks examine one of the four features above by providing an analysis of how this feature should be understood, what distinction within causation it clarifies, and why this distinction matters to scientific practice, as well as everyday causal reasoning.</p>",

The participants will discuss and compare the variety of mathematical tools that have been developed while exploring their relation with standing philosophical issues. The symposium aims to (i) explore different points of view concerning the relevance of quantization procedures to questions of inter-theoretic reduction between classical and quantum mechanics, (ii) consider how different approaches to understanding the emergence of classical behavior are influenced by background assumptions concerning realism or anti-realism in the interpretation of quantum mechanics, and (iii) probe the extent to which quantization methods can aid in the interpretation and ontology of quantum theories, especially concerning the nature of charge and particles in field theories.</p>",

This transdisciplinary aspect of scientific modeling has been the center of philosophical discussion concerned with knowledge transfer. While the parlance of \"transfer\" conveys a conservative process in nature, a growing number of case studies suggests that modifying the body of knowledge or the subject matter to which it applies is indispensable to a satisfactory trans-domain transfer. There is thus a need to address both the conservation and adaptation aspects in the cross-disciplinary transfer of models and their associated knowledge. Tackling this issue, the first two talks clarify and refine notions of \"templates\" for analyzing model transfer. The last two talks focus on the process and the practice of circulating models as templates across disciplines. On the whole, the five speakers-four philosophers of science and a practicing scientist-present an all-round perspective of how scientists are motivated to transfer models, but also appear to modify the knowledge associated with them in the process.</p>",

This symposium proposal takes cues from these discussions, and explores their implications for the philosophy of psychiatry. Mental disorder is an intricate and multi-dimensional phenomenon that is intimately tied to an individual, their biology, and their social and cultural contexts, warranting multiple explanatory frameworks to enhance psychiatric epistemology. Papers in the symposium will examine how psychiatric knowledge is made by reflecting on taxonomies that are based on biological mechanisms, natural kinds, theoretical causal models, as well as those incorporating patients' perspectives and realities. Rather than presupposing that there is one correct taxonomy for psychiatric disorders, these papers proceed on the assumption that different psychiatric taxonomies track different properties and processes, thereby serving different interests (e.g., explanation, prediction, intervention).</p>",

Indeed, stability is part of many conceptual frameworks in ecology and as such, it shapes how researchers apprehend and describe their target system. Perhaps unsurprisingly, debates surrounding this notion are also quite diverse. Many have debated how to define and measure various forms of stability, others have discussed whether it is present or absent in ecological entities, and yet others have endorsed it, sometimes implicitly, as a value in ecological management. The papers in this session will introduce debates in ecology and environmental science that illustrate the centrality of this notion; how it has and still shapes ecological practices and values in important ways.</p>",

Each transition involved a qualitative change in information flow within nervous systems. Each transition opened up new cognitive capacities, while transforming the power and scope of existing cognitive functions. We consider several aspects of the major transitions framework: the role of learning, brain size, and resource constraints on the evolution of nervous systems; the relationship between major transitions and behavioral innovation; and the implications of major transitions on methods in psychology.

It focuses on situations where experts record the opinions of others and adapt their own opinion accordingly, or where a decision maker determines her opinion on the basis of the opinions in a group of experts. The symposium consists of four papers that jointly span the space between psychological studies of deliberation and formal philosophical models of it. All papers are aimed at rationalizing deliberative practices and finding constraints on how rational social learning can obtain. The symposium has a high degree of internal coherence as it builds on a series of workshops held over the past few years within the \"ColAForm\" project, a research network on Collective Attitudes Formation. While focused on a specific set of themes in formal social epistemology, our symposium references a much wider research tradition in social epistemology. Insight into the rationality of social deliberation is highly relevant to studies of the social dimension of scientific inquiry, and hence to the philosophy of science, especially in its focus on science as a social process.</p>",

First, the Fodorian conception of representations as symbols in a computational system still looms large. This has pushed an important minority of cognitive scientists to skepticism about the very notion of representation. Second, there is some tension between our best contemporary theories of representation in philosophy, with their rich foundation of ancillary notions (biological function, sender-receiver architectures, causal-informational connections or asymmetries, structural correspondence, etc.); and actual appeals to representation in science, more austere, and apparently based only on the existence of correlation between neural and worldly variables. </p><p> </p><p> We aim to shed light on these central issues in the philosophy of cognitive science by examining the structure of austere conceptions of representation and information.

The aim of the proposed symposium is to focus on the purpose and legitimacy of speculating in science, and on the question of the nature of the constraints, if any, that should be imposed. Are there legitimate ways to develop as well as evaluate speculations, as speculations, without experimentally testing them?

This situation raises two strategic questions. How can the current status of theories beyond the Standard Model be assessed most adequately? And how should the empirical search for new physics be directed in the most effective way? Both questions are of eminent importance for the future of particle physics and both are rooted in substantial philosophical issues, such as the relation between empirical testing and theoretical analysis or the mechanism of theory confirmation.

While these issues have been extensively debated within applied ethics, philosophers of science have started to recognize that many of them also overlap with current debates in philosophy of science. For instance, the issue of algorithmic bias raises issues of epistemic risk and value-ladenness, while debates over the opacity and interpretability of advanced AI systems raise issues about the nature of explanation and understanding. Furthermore, they raise methodological questions about the sciences that produce these technologies, how research can be organized to produce ethical AI, and what responsibility scientists within these disciplines have to ensure this.

    "abstract": "<p>In this symposium, we describe and analyze scientific practices involving possibility claims, from synthetic and evolutionary biology, climate science, and economics. These practices pose challenges to philosophy of science, including questions about the justification of possibility claims, the representation of possibilities through models, the distinction of genuine from non-genuine possibilities, and what the relevant concept(s) of 'possibility' is in a given field. We advance understanding of these problems by analyzing the possibility claims and the associated practices with tools and arguments from modal epistemology. Although modal epistemology has only addressed scientific possibility claims to a rather limited extent, it has recently undergone an \"empirical turn\", investigating justification strategies for modal claims based on empirical evidence – thus making it amenable to issues in the philosophy of science. The resources from modal epistemology that we are employing include conceptual distinctions, new perspectives, and novel justificatory strategies. With this approach, the symposium aims to achieve three goals. First, it aims to raise awareness of interesting philosophical issues relating to scientific practices involving possibility claims. Second, it advances the philosophical analysis of these issues. Finally, it showcases how drawing on modal epistemology can help philosophy of science in this matter.</p>",

Early philosophical reactions to the Earman-Norton version of the argument focused on articulating and defending versions of substantivalism that could avoid the dire conclusions of the hole argument.

The five talks in this symposium address crucial questions: What makes big data big in any given context, and is big data unique to the contemporary scientific moment? Is the kind of data-centric reasoning highlighted by philosophers in disciplines like genetics and biology contiguous with the use of big data in climate science? Can traditional representational conceptions of data advanced by philosophers account for the malleability of big data?

Precision medicine is often promoted as a unified solution to current challenges in health care without recognition of the complexities of the various contexts of implementation. One example is the ideal of \"patient empowerment\" in primary care, where risk information is envisioned to enable patients to take control over future health outcomes. This vision, however, presupposes quite significant epistemic assumptions, and implies a shift in the organization of health care systems. This includes changes in the relationship between doctors and patients, as well as in their respective roles and responsibilities. The symposium offers an overview of how precision medicine has developed as a promissory science, recently distancing itself from \"personalized medicine\", and calls for a calibration of expectations according to existing evidence of health benefits.</p>",

Questions to be addressed include: Can justice be the, or an, aim of science? How do scientists deal with injustices in specific contexts? How can scientists work to ensure science does not contribute to injustice? And what does a science for the purpose of justice look like?

Does it involve only epistemic responsibilities or it includes moral constraints? Whose needs does socially responsible science address? Is it the needs of the general public, stakeholders affected by the research, or groups with certain characteristics (e.g., marginalized, least well off)? What are the specific responsibilities scientists are accountable for in order for science so be socially responsible? Are they accountable for the research problems addressed, the methodologies employed, the resulting products, or some combination of these? What mechanisms (e.g., public engagement?) might be necessary for, or can facilitate, socially responsible science? This symposium brings together a diverse group of philosophers of science to address these questions.</p>",

The four concepts considered are: 'slow infection', 'Wilsonian renormalization', 'homology', and 'species'. The papers share an emphasis on considering epistemic functions beyond mere reference; in this way, they contribute to an expanded view of the functions of scientific language.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Statistical methods play an essential role in an extremely wide range of human reasoning. From theorizing in the physical and social sciences to determining evidential standards in legal contexts, statistical methods are ubiquitous, and so are questions about their adequate application. As tools for making inferences that go beyond a given set of data, they are inherently a means of inductive, or ampliative reasoning, and so it is unsurprising that philosophers have used statistical frameworks to further our understanding of these topics. Yet statistical methods are undergoing considerable debate with important implications for standards of research across social and biological science. In the last decade many published results in the medical and social sciences have been found not to replicate. This has sparked debates about the very nature of statistical inference and modeling. Combining perspectives from philosophy, statistics, psychology, and economics, our symposium focuses on these recent debates. It will be a topical session building on Deborah Mayo's Statistical Inference as Severe Testing: How to Get Beyond the Statistics Wars (CUP, 2018), and a 2019 Summer Seminar on Philosophy of Statistics co-directed by D. Mayo and A. Spanos, in which all presenters of our proposed session participated (<a href=\"https://summerseminarphilstat.com/\"><u>https://summerseminarphilstat.com/</u></a>).</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Since its birth, cognitive science has taken inspiration from computer science, using state-of-art technologies as models for how the human mind works. Today, cognitive scientists are beginning to grapple with Deep Neural Nets, perhaps the most impressive and difficult to understand advances in computing thus far. The striking success of DNNs suggests that perhaps there are deep similarities between them and the human mind. However, DNNs display bizarre behaviors and their inner workings are (allegedly) inscrutable, which would seem to undermine their value as a model of the mind. </p><p>In this symposium, we will examine the status of machine learning models of cognition. First, supposing that the analogy is a probative one, we suggest that it sheds light on traditional philosophical controversies about concepts. Second, we will critically examine the evidence from adversarial examples that has been taken undermine the similarity between human and machine concepts. Lastly, we will discuss how tools used to investigate human minds can break open the \"black box\" of DNNs.</p><p>This investigation will introduce philosophers of science to cutting edge work in machine learning and cognitive science, and provide a fascinating case study of the use of model systems in science.</p>",

The consistent determination of dozens of fundamental constants provides the most stringent tests of current physical theories. Despite the remarkable success of these measurements, philosophers have not yet focused sufficient attention on the reasons for this success and the nature of the knowledge that emerges out of it. The aim of this symposium is to explore the nature of this knowledge by bringing together the perspectives of philosophy of physics, the philosophy of scientific methodology, and the philosophy of measurement. Among other topics, the symposium will examine the nature of scientific evidence emerging from precision measurement of physical constants in quantum electrodynamics and cosmology; provide new insights into the nature of scientific units and their connection to physical constants; and show how the precision measurement of physical constants can provide strategies for resolving methodological conundrums.</p>",

This symposium will ask: is low sexual desire a genuine disease? What is a 'sexuality', and how many in fact are there? How should we interpret the empirical evidence pertaining to alleged sex-differences in sexual desire? Should some topics of research about our sexual desires be prohibited on normative grounds? To generate a robust discussion about these important and challenging questions and topics, our symposium includes a professionally and demographically diverse range of participants.</p>",

Recently, the AAPT has partnered with other philosophical associations to run \"Teaching Hubs\" at those conferences. Teaching Hubs aim to bring active, student-centered teaching discussions and resources to the wider audience of philosophy instructors. This AAPT-PSA Teaching Hub seeks to bring AAPT-style pedagogy to the problems facing the teaching of philosophy of science.</p><p>The AAPT-PSA Teaching Hub is a series of interactive workshops and conversations designed specifically for philosophers of science and created to celebrate teaching within the context of the PSA biannual meetings. Organized by the American Association of Philosophy Teachers, the Teaching Hub aims to offer a range of high quality and inclusive development opportunities that address the teaching of philosophy of science at all levels, pre-college though graduate school. This session first provides a brief introduction to AAPT Teaching Hubs, followed by two workshop sessions: (1) The Thinking Science project, which aims to bring philosophical questioning to science education for schoolchildren. This extension of the project covers various topics involving AI, big data and robotics. (2) \"Robust Classrooms: Redesigning Science Learning\" details an approach to teaching that scientific modeling necessarily involves choices and the integration of visual technology. The session leaders have implemented this teaching strategy through the modeling of COVID-19. Additionally, the session leaders will demonstrate one way to effectively integrate visual technology into a group project about modeling.</p><p><br /></p>",

    "abstract": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Case Studies: Putting the H back in HPS</p><p><br /></p><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the perennial themes in the field of \"integrated HPS\" is the question about the nature and role of case studies for historical and philosophical analyses of science. What philosophical lessons, if any, can we draw from examining specific historical events and processes? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the decades after the historical turn of philosophy of science in the wake of Lakatos, Kuhn, Laudan, and others, HPS was associated with the notion that philosophical concepts and ideas should be tested against the historical record. Case studies were expected to probe the historical adequacy, and thus the relevance to science, of philosophical concepts and theories about science. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">During the last decade or so, however, the notion that philosophical concepts and theories could be empirically tested has been cast into doubt. What could it mean to \"test\" philosophical concepts against the historical record? Is it really a \"test\" of a philosophical concept if we find an episode that fits with that concept? How can we prevent cherry-picking our cases? Should we study cases that could potentially refute our philosophical theories? What could the terms \"fit\" or \"refute\" even mean in this context? What can we learn from a single case study, or even a few case studies, about science tout court? And what are \"case studies\" anyway? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Yet, despite all these misgivings regarding the idea that we should test philosophy of science with cases, investigating actual scientific episodes remains a crucial part of HPS. In their attempts to find more appropriate characterizations of the nature and role of historical case studies for philosophy of science, scholars within the field, including Hasok Chang (2012) and Katherina Kinzel (2015), among others, have moved the discussion beyond the simple notion of \"testing philosophy with cases\". This session further examines the nature of case studies and their role for philosophical inquiry through illustration and systematic analysis. Three of the papers present historical episodes drawn from different fields of inquiry and different historical periods: the construction of a cervimeter to measure cervical dilation (Jackson); the application of Bohr's atomic model to helium (Kaveh); and research on scorpion suicide (Arnet). Each presenter utilizes the case study to consider broader philosophical issues: the concept of units of measurement (Jackson); predictive success (Kaveh); and continuity and change in scientific knowledge production (Arnet); to reflect on the question of how the historical material could help clarify the philosophical issues at stake. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The three concrete analyses are framed by a paper (Bolinska & Martin) and a commentary (Chang) which discuss the structure and functions of historical case studies more abstractly. Together, the five contributions to this session provide rich opportunities to think through questions such as: What are the distinctive features of philosophically informed case studies of past science? How strictly should our case studies adhere to the standards of professional history of science? What makes particular historical episodes good, fruitful, and suitable for philosophical analysis? What kinds of philosophical insights can be gained by engaging with historical cases, and might the work with cases perhaps constrain or limit philosophical analyses in certain ways? </p><p><br /></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Kinzel, K., Narrative and evidence.

Second, we illuminate how how-possibly explanations relate to economic</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">modelling practices and how they are used to acquire how-actually explanations of phenomena</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of interest. Third, we provide methodological resources to appraise how-possibly explanations in</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economics.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\"><br /></p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">Topic description (991)</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">How we can learn about the world with highly idealized models has been a vexing philosophical</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">issue. These models often do not faithfully describe the world as it is, yet it also seems they are</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">not epistemically vacuous. Philosophers have started to draw attention to the modal features of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">scientific modelling (e.g. Betz 2015; Bokulich 2014; Knuuttila and Koskinen 2020; Massimi</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">2019; Rice 2016; Shech and Gelfert 2019; Weisberg 2013). According to that growing body of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">literature, scientists sometimes seek to establish possibility claims. For instance, biologists</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">synthesize potential organisms (Elowitz and Lim 2010) and physicists model impossible</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">perpetual motion machines (Feynman, Leighton, and Sands 2010) to further our understanding of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">the world. They pursue the epistemic goals of science by inquiring into the possible and</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">impossible.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">We observe a similar interest concerning economic models. They are sometimes said to describe</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">credible worlds (Sugden 2000, 2009), establish possibility claims to rebut impossibility ones</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">(Grüne-Yanoff 2009), or provide how-possibly explanations (Aydinonat 2007, 2008; Ylikoski</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">and Aydinonat 2014). All this draws attention to the modal features of economic modelling</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">(Hausman 1984; Rappaport 1986, 1989, 1998): economics pursues not only its aims by</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">investigating what is actual, but also what is possible. Moreover, while some philosophers of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economics are pessimistic about the capacities of economic models to accurately represent the</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">actual world and explain (Alexandrova and Northcott 2013), others have suggested that they</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">might fare better as representations of genuine possibilities (Grüne-Yanoff 2013; Verreault-</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">Julien 2017; Ylikoski and Aydinonat 2014), thus offering an alternative and nuanced vindication</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of current economic modelling practices.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\"><br /></p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">The methodology of economics needs this nuance. Prediction and explanation are commonly</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">considered as the most important goals of economic modelling. Yet, typical accounts of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economic modelling that rely on representational adequacy and robustness as criteria for success</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">suggest that most economic models fail to achieve these goals (Aydinonat and Köksal 2019). It is</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">true that economic models often do not meet the decomposability assumptions needed for</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">minimalist accounts of idealization (Cartwright 2009; Grüne-Yanoff 2011) and that most of them</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">are not robust to many kinds of de-idealizations (Knuuttila and Morgan 2019). Thus, they are</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">unlikely candidates for providing good predictions or explanations. But it does not follow from</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">this that most economic modelling is deficient. The reason is that the dominant accounts of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economic modelling do not do much justice to practice of economic modelling and particularly</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">to its modal features. Before dismissing these practices as epistemically inert, one must invest</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">more effort in investigating the role models play in establishing modal claims and providing</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">how-possibly explanations.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">However, we currently have a limited understanding of modal modelling. No systematic survey</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of modal modelling practices in economics exists, and few proposals have been offered how to</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">categorize and systematize these practices. Nor are there clear analyses of the epistemic</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">contributions of economic modal modelling. Do they consist in how-possibly explanations that</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">have epistemic value in their own right, or do they indirectly contribute to how-actually</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanations, and only through that acquire value? Furthermore, we also lack methodological</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">criteria for assessing the quality of specific how-possibly explanations.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">This session focusses on those modelling practices that relate to how-possibly explanations. It</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">consists of three papers that examine distinct features of how-possibly explanations in</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">economics. Each paper documents some specific modal modelling practices in economics,</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">ranging from central bank modelling through trade theory to modelling cooperation. Each paper</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">then analyses how these practices make a substantial epistemic contribution, and concludes by</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">identifying criteria for assessing the quality of these modal modelling practices.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">The first paper focusses on models considered potential candidates for providing causal</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanations, as one finds them, e.g., in central bank multi-model platforms. When considered on</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">their own, these models merely provide 'thin' how-possibly explanations of little epistemic</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">value. Yet, in practice, these models are crucial for acquiring how-actually explanations. The</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">paper illustrates such practices by showing how the Bank of England integrates multiple how-</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">possibly models in its COMPASS platform, aiming at how-actually explanation of real-world </p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">phenomena, and it investigates the success conditions of such how-actually explanations in terms</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of how well they facilitate reasoning about reliable intervention.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">The second paper emphasizes that economists often make use of multiple models along with</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">other sources of information in their quest for explaining actual phenomena. Therefore,</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">individual models rarely function as explanantia. Rather, economists typically use a set of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">models (each of them highly idealized) to construct a 'menu' of possible explanations,</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">viz. explanations whose truth isn't yet established. When doing so, they rely on a diversity of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">models and sources of evidence. Determining the actual explanation is then a matter of</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">eliminating the possible candidate explanations and establishing the truth of the relevant</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanantia.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">The third paper argues that the practice of providing 'mere' how-possibly explanations does not</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">entitle economists to formulate any just-so story they wish. It proposes a conceptual framework</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">that allows assessing 'good' from 'bad' how-possibly explanations. This conceptual framework</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">relies on two key distinctions: the first between how-actually and how-possibly explanations, the</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">second between epistemic and objective how-possibly explanations. It argues that both of these</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">latter categories afford their own epistemically relevant results, and both have the conceptual</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">resources to distinguish between good and bad models. The paper illustrates these arguments</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">with examples from trade theory, economic geography, and social cooperation.</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">With these three presentations, the session aims to further our understanding of how-possibly</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanations and modal modelling in economics. In particular, we pursue three goals. First, we</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">show that the practice of establishing modal claims is well entrenched in the modelling strategies</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">of economists, even those with an eye on policy. Second, we illuminate how how-possibly</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">explanations make substantial epistemic contributions, either by establishing relevant free-</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">standing modal claims or by facilitating, in conjunction with other sources of information, the</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">development of how-actually explanations of phenomena of interest. Third, we provide</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">methodological guidelines for assessing the quality of how-possibly explanations, thus showing</p><p style=\"line-height: 1;\">that they are distinct from methodologically naive just-so stories.</p>",

Using a virtue ethics framework, Peebles introduces three constraints for the</p><p>permissible use of BRC in medicine, while withholding any metaphysical commitment to the reality</p><p>of these classifications.

    "abstract": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Pluralism and Integration in Human Cognitive and Behavioral Sciences</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Philosophical accounts of the structure of science or of individual scientific disciplines (e.g., biology) have either endorsed a pluralism about scientific methods and explanatory models, or argued for integrative relations among fields and scientific ideas. An important case in point is the scientific study of human cognition and behavior, which because of its attempts to explain human aggression, sexuality, or gender differences has potential policy implications and has witnessed public controversy. Recently, Helen Longino has prominently argued for a strong pluralism, by maintaining that the different approaches to the study of human behavior cannot be integrated because they are incommensurable.</p><p>This symposium both takes a critical look at arguments for pluralism and analyzes novel cases from neuroscience and human behavior research, with the aim of revealing the presence of integrative relations or the potential for future integration. Our case studies range from behavior genetics to the neuroscience of face recognition, radical embodied cognitive science, and neuropsychiatry. Several of these philosophical cases have been developed based on collaborative interactions with cognitive and behavioral scientists. </p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Nature of Science and the Communication of Biopolitics</p><p dir=\"ltr\">During the COVID-19 crisis, unfortunately in most cases, both mainstream media and social media have reproduced one way of thinking: a politicized scientism. Science in all areas of research is characterized by open dialogue, conflicting arguments and multiple approaches in solving scientific problems. This image of science has disappeared from the public awareness for almost two years now. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the first paper of this symposium, an analysis of a series of on line videos and the comments that follow them as well as a variety of published on line articles where politicians, scientists and citizens present their ideas about the COVID-19 crisis is being presented. Results show that certain sequences in the structure of language and arguments concerning the aspects of the nature of science are present in the way politicians, scientists and citizens present their approach towards the COVID-19 crisis. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the one hand, those supporting the biopolitically accepted as correct agenda present minimum nature of the science content in their arguments, while completely miss the synthetic nature of science as a product and the nature of the evolution and the methodologies of science. Nevertheless, they overemphasize on elements concerning the nature of the science context and the interrelations between science and society that impose demands on scientific research and development coming from power centers and power figures of modern society, having a result on spreading bio-biased attitudes to the community. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, scientists and citizens engaged in public on line dialogues, present high input of the nature of the science content, of the synthetic nature of science as a product and of the nature of the evolution and the methodologies of science. In this case, the nature of the science context and the nature of the interrelations between science and society are brought forward in order to express the suppression of theories and research results that disagree with the biopolitically accepted as correct agenda to the extent of science being censored, while bioethics arguments point out the necessity of discussing about the nature of attitudes and values expressed though and fostered by science. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the second paper of the symposium, the case of Sweden is discussed. The Swedish authorities have referred heavily to 'evidence' and 'lack of evidence' when motivating the use or non-use of different regulations. For example, the Swedish state epidemiologist for a long time argued against the use of masks by the general public, due to lack of evidence of its usefulness to prevent the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The reference to evidence/lack of evidence has been praised as well as criticized in the general debate involving the general public, politicians as well as scientists. The relationship between policy decisions and scientific knowledge is always complex. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The debate on what actions should be taken in relation to COVID-19 would benefit from scientists, policy stakeholders, politicians and the general public clarifying pros and cons, risks and benefits, and the values guiding the choices between different possible actions. In addition, in issues such as what actions to take in relation to the COVID-19 virus, the situation is even more complex since \"how the world 'is'\" is subject to ongoing research – the evidence is not clear, nor is there agreement on what counts as evidence, or what constitutes reasonable evidence requirements. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The paper suggests that science education should learn from the ongoing pandemic and reconsider simplistic notions of 'evidence' and 'investigations' described in secondary science textbooks, where processes of science are described as formulating a hypothesis, planning and performing an investigation and drawing conclusions, while 'messy' research processes and the nature of ongoing research are often left out. In addition, the relationship between ongoing research, evidence, and policy decisions should be discussed in more detail than what is usually the case, due to its importance for citizenship and everyday life. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The third paper of the symposium discusses the fact that many individuals and students in particular, often do not have the tools to discern quality scientific information from tentative or poor quality information. They often fail to recognize pseudoscience, false information, or propaganda. Therefore, key foundational pedagogical concepts that are needed to develop the ability to evaluate scientific information are proposed such as: a) how inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning work together to build scientific knowledge, b) how one can categorize types of scientific knowledge based on their tentativeness, c) how argument and evidence are codified by citations and referencing, d) how peer-review, publishing, and review articles are crucial in developing scientific consensus and e) how to find and access quality science information.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the fourth paper of this symposium, the discussion focuses on the demand from society towards science education researchers to make proposals for digital educational material and teaching strategies that would help teachers understand and then be able to help their students learn what a virus triggered disease is and what medical research has to offer to tackle it. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The need for a logical, distant from the current moment, objective approach and presentation in digital narratives created about diseases, their medicines and their vaccines, is presented coupled with the challenge designers and developers of digital narratives face to make an emotional over-ride, that is to find one or more tricks or perspectives that distract the audience from getting too emotionally involved. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">A digital narrative is presented in this paper that has been created based on history of science and history of medicine about diseases and attempts to point out elements of the nature of science about disease and treatment. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The analysis of research data coming from interviews with teachers and students shows the impact of the developed digital narrative and opens the discussion on the educational demands of teachers and students for digital educational material and teaching approaches about diseases, medicines and vaccines especially in the current times when digital science narratives contribute to the on-line spread of information to citizens.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the fifth paper of this symposium, attention is brought to the importance to identify what content is privileged around health and disease in science curricula, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, pointing out the urgent task to help science teachers move from information to knowledge enabling action, exploring a multi-causal and multi-referential approach conveyed through narratives. The potential of the narrative format is examined in order to provide context, information and relations for students to explain aspects of pandemics from the past, present and future. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Current education seems in competition with circulation of information facilitated by new technologies. The problem is that this \"non-processed\" information serves for little more than being used in non-productive ways. </p><p dir=\"ltr\">In this scenario, how can schools take profit of their position in society? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">Is school science preparing students to understand the links between ecosystemic degradation and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">How can \"standard\" scientific content cope with socio-scientific issues such as whether \"generalist\" preventive measures are applicable in complex and sensitive contexts? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">What is the robustness of these \"epistemic\" operations based on a list of biomedical data on COVID-19? </p><p dir=\"ltr\">The paper examines the potential of scientific narratives to provide context, information and relations necessary for students to explain through theoretical models key aspects of pandemics aligning with the incorporation of an \"integrated view\" into school science and using narratives as a powerful vehicle to implement it in science classrooms.</p>",
